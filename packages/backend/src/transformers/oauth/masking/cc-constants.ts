 * constants.ts (which itself is a byte-for-byte port of Shadow's
 * `openclaw-routing-layer/proxy.js` v2.2.3) and de-vendored so v2 no longer
 * depends on the eliza plugin. Only the OAuth-masking pipeline actually
 * needed anything from that plugin — v1 (transformers/oauth/oauth-
 * claude.ts) proves the eliza dependency was never load-bearing for Claude
 * Code fingerprinting in general, and roughly half of what the vendored
 * pipeline did was already a no-op for non-eliza clients (see this file's
 * git history / apply-masking.ts for the audit).
 *
 * These are upstream-detection-bypass surface: the values below encode
 * what a genuine Claude Code CLI session's requests look like, and MUST
 * match reality or Anthropic's abuse detection flags the traffic as
 * non-CC (see debug traces 1e0a037d-54a2-4358-ac53-75ade3a1f875,
 * 7754cf0d-f083-44d2-8e57-fe41ce1f7592, 17404760-e986-49b3-8a20-
 * f1a4a469a0ac for the failure modes each of these fixes). Each constant
 * below documents where to look if it ever needs updating.
