/**
 * Single entry point for the v2 Claude Code OAuth-masking transformation
 * pipeline applied to an outgoing Anthropic `/v1/messages` request body.
 *
 * Fully v2-native — no dependency on vendor/eliza/plugins/plugin-anthropic-
 * proxy. That package was audited (see cc-constants.ts's module doc) and
 * found to be mostly dead weight for this use case: half its layers
 * (`stripSystemConfig`, assistant-prefill strip, thinking-block strip) are
 * either eliza-specific no-ops for any other client or speculative behavior
 * never confirmed necessary for our traffic; the CCH-signing gap it left
 * (see sign-billing.ts) and the tool-rename dictionary gap it left (see
 * registry.ts) were the actual production bugs this pipeline exists to fix.
 * v1 (`transformers/oauth/oauth-claude.ts`) already proves the eliza
 * dependency was never load-bearing for Claude Code fingerprinting in
 * general — it has zero vendor/eliza imports. The remaining genuinely
 * useful surface (fingerprint constants, the billing-hash formula, the
 * synthetic tool list) is ported natively with sourcing comments in
 * cc-constants.ts so it can be independently re-derived from a real Claude
 * Code capture if Anthropic ever changes these values.
 *
 * Pipeline, in order (each step's rationale is documented at its own
 * module — this is just the composition):
 *
 *   1. `buildToolRenamePairs()` — compute renames: real-Claude-Code-name
 *      collisions with an incompatible shape (`cc-collision-shape.ts`), and
 *      MCP-server tools clustered into the `mcp__<server>__<tool>`
 *      convention (`mcp-shape.ts`).
 *   2. `applyToolRenames()` — apply those renames across `tools[]`,
 *      `tool_choice`, and any `tool_use` blocks in message history.
 *   3. `stripDescriptionsAndInjectSyntheticTools()` — preserve caller tool
 *      descriptions, except collision renames get a note appended instructing
 *      the model to prefer them over the real CC tool of their original name;
 *      prepend the synthetic Claude Code tool stubs.
 *   4. `dedupeSyntheticToolCollisions()` — defensive backstop for the rare
 *      case a computed rename collides with one of the synthetic names.
 *   5. `injectClaudeCodeIdentity()` — replace `system[]` with the genuine
 *      Claude Code system-prompt shape; relocate the caller's real system
 *      content into the first user message.
 *   6. `injectClaudeCodeMetadata()` — set `metadata.user_id` to the
 *      device_id/session_id shape real Claude Code sends.
 *   7. `signBillingHeader()` — sign the CCH placeholder over the finalized
 *      body. Must run last so the signature covers everything above.
