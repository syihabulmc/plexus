/**
 * Resolves the ordered list of ProviderAdapters for a given route.
 *
 * Resolution order:
 *   1. Implicit adapters automatically injected for the route's target
 *      provider (currently: tool-search stripping for `pi_ai_provider ===
 *      'openrouter'`), its model (GPT-5 option suppression) and its
 *      provider+wire-format pair (Anthropic tool-id normalization, gated on
 *      BOTH the outbound wire format being Anthropic Messages AND the target
 *      looking like an Anthropic provider — an `anthropic.com` base URL,
 *      Anthropic OAuth, or Claude masking). These run first so
 *      user-configured adapters see the cleaned-up payload if they inspect it.
 *   2. Provider-level `adapter` (applies to all models under the provider)
 *   3. Model-level `adapter`   (appended after provider-level adapters)
 *
 * An `{ name, enabled: false }` entry removes earlier instances of that adapter,
 * including implicit defaults. A later enabled entry restores it. That makes the
 * provider/model `adapter` array the override channel in BOTH directions: a
 * `{ name, enabled: false }` tombstone opts a detected-Anthropic route out, and
 * a `{ name, options: {}, enabled: true }` entry force-enables the adapter on a
 * route the implicit gate skipped (e.g. an Anthropic-compatible gateway hosted
 * on some other domain).
 *
 * Each entry is an { name, options } object. Unknown adapter names are logged
 * as warnings and skipped (rather than throwing) so that a misconfigured
 * adapter doesn't take down the whole route.
 *
 * Returns an empty array when no adapters are configured — zero-cost path.
 *
 * @param effectiveApiType Pass the FINAL outbound wire type — request-manager's
 *   `effectiveApiType`, NOT `targetApiType` (which can be 'oauth' or
 *   subtype-carrying). When omitted (e.g. legacy callers/tests), no
 *   format-scoped implicit adapters are injected.

/**
 * Adapters automatically injected for a route based on its target pi-ai
 * provider, its model id and its provider/outbound-wire-format pair,
 * independent of user-configured adapters.
 *
 * The `pi_ai_provider === 'openrouter'` entry fires because OpenRouter's
 * Anthropic-compat /v1/messages endpoint only accepts a small subset of
 * Anthropic server-tool shorthands and rejects the rest with HTTP 400
 * "Unknown server-tool shorthand". We strip the unsupported ones (currently
 * `tool_search_tool_*`) so that messages<>messages pass-through and the
 * transformer-driven dispatch both end up with a body OpenRouter will accept.
 *
 * The tool-id normalizer's gate has TWO parts, and both must hold:
 *
 *   1. The route's FINAL outbound wire type is Anthropic Messages (base type of
 *      `effectiveApiType`, so subtypes such as `messages:<subtype>` are covered
 *      too). Foreign ids reach an Anthropic-shaped body both through the
 *      messages->messages pass-through and through cross-format transforms, so
 *      the repair cannot be attached to a single transformer.
 *   2. The target actually looks like an Anthropic provider
 *      (`isAnthropicTargetProvider`: an `anthropic.com` base URL, Anthropic
 *      OAuth, or Claude masking) — judged on the URL this very dispatch would
 *      use, so a record `api_base_url` is read at its `effectiveApiType` key
 *      rather than collectively. Not every messages-format target is
 *      Anthropic — plenty of proxies and self-hosted gateways speak the
 *      Messages wire format without enforcing Anthropic's tool-id charset, and
 *      rewriting ids there would mutate ids the client matches against on the
 *      next turn for no benefit.
 *
 * Anthropic itself hard-400s on tool ids outside `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$`. For an
 * Anthropic-compatible gateway on some other host that enforces the same
 * charset, add `{ name: 'normalize_anthropic_tool_ids', options: {}, enabled:
 * true }` to that provider's (or model's) `adapter` array; conversely a
 * `{ name: 'normalize_anthropic_tool_ids', enabled: false }` entry opts a
 * detected-Anthropic route out. `effectiveApiType` (not `targetApiType`) is the
 * only value that reflects the real protocol for native-OAuth routes.
 *
 * Implicit adapters go through the same registry path as user-configured
 * adapters, so an unresolved name here would fail loudly rather than
 * silently no-op.

/**
 * Does this route target Anthropic itself (as opposed to some other upstream
 * that merely speaks the Messages wire format)?
 *
 * Three signals, any of which is sufficient:
 *
 *   - An `anthropic.com` base URL. This mirrors the idiom `getProviderTypes()`
 *     already uses to infer the 'messages' type from a string URL
 *     (`config.ts`), extended to the record form so that
 *     `{ messages: 'https://…anthropic.com/v1' }` is recognized too.
 *   - An `oauth://` base URL whose OAuth provider is `anthropic`. The
 *     `oauth://` test mirrors `isOAuthRouteForNative`
 *     (`request-payload-builder.ts`) minus its `targetApiType === 'oauth'`
 *     short-circuit: this resolver only ever sees `effectiveApiType`, and
 *     native-OAuth Anthropic routes arrive here already resolved to 'messages'.
 *     The `oauth_provider || route.provider` slug fallback copies
 *     `request-manager.ts`'s own resolution of the native OAuth provider.
 *     `isNativeOAuthRoute` is deliberately NOT reused: it matches codex and
 *     copilot too, which are not Anthropic targets.
 *   - `useClaudeMasking`, the provider-name-agnostic Claude-masking API-key
 *     route, which is Anthropic by construction (and so is URL-independent).
 *
 * The `includes('anthropic.com')` substring test is as loose as
 * `getProviderTypes()`'s — accepted for parity. A false positive only injects an
 * idempotent, deterministic id rewrite that a
 * `{ name: 'normalize_anthropic_tool_ids', enabled: false }` adapter entry
 * disables.
 *
 * @param effectiveApiType The FINAL outbound wire type. For the RECORD form of
 *   `api_base_url` this scopes the URL check to the entry the dispatcher would
 *   actually send to (see `selectDispatchUrls`), so a provider whose `messages`
 *   URL is a third-party proxy is not judged by an unrelated `chat` URL that
 *   happens to point at anthropic.com. Omit it (legacy callers/tests) to fall
 *   back to scanning every value in the record.
