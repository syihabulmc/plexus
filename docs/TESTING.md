# Testing Guide

This is the source of truth for Plexus testing conventions. Follow these rules before using generic Vitest examples. File paths are relative to the repository root unless marked otherwise.

## Running Tests

### Standard Run

From the repo root:

```bash
bun run test
```

Or from the backend package:

```bash
cd packages/backend
bun run test
```

> **Note:** `bun test` is intentionally blocked both at repo root and in `packages/backend` (via `bunfig.toml`). Use `bun run test` instead.

The default test command uses `--changed HEAD` and runs only tests affected by uncommitted changes. Use this unless you have a specific reason to run the full suite.

### Full Suite

```bash
bun run test:force
```

### Watch Mode

```bash
bun run test:watch
```

### Manual Testing (Dev Environment)

For agent-driven checks, start or reuse the worktree-safe background stack:

```bash
bun run dev:agent --detach
```

Use the printed port for the UI at `http://localhost:<PORT>/ui/` and API requests at `http://localhost:<PORT>/v1/...`.
For browser-visible changes, follow the [frontend-testing skill](../.claude/skills/frontend-testing/SKILL.md), including real-browser interaction and persistence checks.
See [Development](../CONTRIBUTING.md#development) for foreground mode, lifecycle commands, environment setup, and FRP tunnels.

### Dev Data Management (`prep-dev`)

The `prep-dev` script manages your local dev environment data. It combines the old `pull-staging`, `populate-dev`, and `clear-dev` scripts into one.

**Basic usage:**

```bash
bun run prep-dev            # Load saved local data (default)
bun run prep-dev:save       # Download from staging & save locally
bun run prep-dev:live       # Use staging data directly (one-off)
bun run prep-dev:clear      # Clear local dev data
bun run prep-dev:reset      # Clear then load saved data
```

**Saving data from staging:**

```bash
PLEXUS_STAGING_URL=https://plexus.home.cowger.us \
PLEXUS_STAGING_ADMIN_KEY=your_staging_key \
bun run prep-dev:save
```

This downloads staging data to `.dev-data/backup.tar.gz` (gitignored). Future calls to `bun run prep-dev` will use this saved file.

**Environment variables:**

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `PLEXUS_STAGING_URL` | For --save/--live | URL of staging instance |
| `PLEXUS_STAGING_ADMIN_KEY` | For --save/--live | Admin key for staging |
| `PLEXUS_DEV_DATA_PATH` | No | Path for saved data (default: `.dev-data/`) |
| `PLEXUS_URL` | No | Local base URL (default: `http://localhost`) |
| `PLEXUS_PORT` | No | Local port (auto-derived from cwd) |
| `PLEXUS_ADMIN_KEY` | No | Admin key for local (default: `password`) |
| `PLEXUS_EXCLUDE_OAUTH` | No | Exclude OAuth providers (default: `true`) |

**Notes:**
- The local port is auto-derived from your directory name (matches `bun run dev`)
- OAuth providers are excluded by default to avoid credential conflicts
- After restore, restart the dev server if needed. Use `bun run dev:stop` to
  stop the full stack before starting it again.

## Test Architecture

Backend tests run on **Vitest** with three parallel projects defined in `packages/backend/vitest.config.ts`:

| Project | Purpose | DB Setup |
|---------|---------|----------|
| `unit` | General unit tests (DB mocked) | None |
| `sqlite` | DB-layer tests against SQLite | Temp SQLite DB + migrations |
| `postgres` | DB-layer tests against Postgres (pglite) | Temp pglite DB + migrations |

The `DB_TEST_FILES` list in `vitest.db-tests.ts` determines which files run in the `sqlite` and `postgres` projects. All other test files run only in the `unit` project.

### Key Vitest Settings

| Setting | Value | Effect |
|---------|-------|--------|
| `pool` | `forks` | Each test file runs in a child process fork |
| `isolate` | `true` | Each test file gets a fresh module registry |
| `mockReset` | `true` | `vi.resetAllMocks()` before every test — clears `vi.fn()` call history and resets implementations to original |
| `clearMocks` | `true` | Clears call history (redundant with mockReset but explicit) |
| `restoreMocks` | `true` | Restores `vi.spyOn` mocks to originals after every test |

### Global Setup

`packages/backend/test/vitest.global-setup.ts` — creates a temporary DB, runs migrations once, cleans up after the run. Runs once per project that needs it (`sqlite` and `postgres`).

### Per-File Setup

`packages/backend/test/vitest.setup.ts` — runs once per test file. Installs the logger mock and the `@earendil-works/pi-ai` mock.

## Test File Organization

```
packages/backend/
├── src/
│   └── <module>/
│       ├── foo.ts                   # source file
│       └── __tests__/
│           └── foo.test.ts          # unit test — lives next to the source it tests
└── test/
    ├── vitest.setup.ts              # per-file setup (mocks, doubles)
    ├── vitest.global-setup.ts       # once-per-run setup (DB creation, migrations)
    ├── test-utils.ts                # shared spy/mock helpers
    ├── bun-test-guard/              # meta guard — excluded from Vitest
    └── integration/
        └── vision-*.test.ts         # multi-component / cross-service tests
```

**Rules:**
- **Unit tests** go in a `__tests__/` subdirectory alongside the source file they test under `packages/backend/src/`. Use relative imports.
- **Integration tests** (tests that exercise multiple services/components together) go in `packages/backend/test/integration/`.
- **Infrastructure** (setup files, shared utilities) stays in `packages/backend/test/` directly.
- **Never** put unit tests directly in `packages/backend/test/`, and never put integration tests inside `packages/backend/src/`.
- The backend-relative Vitest `include` globs (`src/**/*.test.ts` and `test/**/*.test.ts`) cover both locations automatically.

## Mocking Rules

### Globally Mocked Modules

Registered in `packages/backend/test/vitest.setup.ts` — **do NOT re-mock in test files**:

- `packages/backend/src/utils/logger` — logger, logEmitter, level helpers
- `@earendil-works/pi-ai` — getModels, getModel, complete (`vi.fn`), stream (`vi.fn`)

### `@earendil-works/pi-ai` Specifics

- `getModels` covers all providers tests need including `openai-codex` and `anthropic`
- `getModel` always returns the `api` field — `OAuthTransformer.executeRequest` dispatches on `model.api` and throws "No API provider registered" without it
- `complete` and `stream` are `vi.fn()`. Because `mockReset: true` wipes them between tests, any test that needs a specific return value must call `vi.mocked(piAi.complete).mockResolvedValue(...)` in `beforeEach`

### Adding New Module Mocks

If a test needs to mock a module **not** already in `vitest.setup.ts`, it may add its own `vi.mock` factory. That mock will be active only for that file's execution. Do not duplicate a mock already registered globally.

### Using `registerSpy`

Always use `registerSpy` from `packages/backend/test/test-utils.ts` instead of raw `vi.spyOn`. It registers the spy in a global tracker that the `test-utils` global `afterEach` automatically restores after every test, preventing leaks across files. Adjust the relative import to the test file's location:

```typescript
import { registerSpy } from '../../../test/test-utils';

// Instead of:
const spy = vi.spyOn(authManager, 'getApiKey');

// Use:
const spy = registerSpy(authManager, 'getApiKey').mockResolvedValue('token');
```

### `mockReset: true` and `vi.fn()` Implementations

`mockReset: true` resets all `vi.fn()` instances before every test:

- `vi.fn()` (no impl) → implementation becomes `undefined` (returns undefined)
- `vi.fn(impl)` → implementation resets to the original `impl`

This means a global mock's `complete: vi.fn(async () => ({...}))` is safe — after reset it still works. But any `mockResolvedValue`/`mockImplementation` applied during a test is wiped before the next. Always re-apply overrides in `beforeEach`.

## Singletons and Test Isolation

Several services are singletons (e.g., `OAuthAuthManager`, `CooldownManager`, `DebugManager`). Reset each singleton used by the test in `beforeEach` using its provided `resetForTesting()` or equivalent helper, such as `ConfigService.resetInstance()`. Use `afterEach` for any additional cleanup the service requires. A singleton left in a non-default state in one test can leak into subsequent tests.

## Other Rules

- Both root and backend `bunfig.toml` files block raw `bun test`. Use `bun run test` or `bun run test:watch` from the repository root; those scripts run the backend tests.
- **Prefer `bun run test` (affected only) over `bun run test:force` (full suite from the repository root).** The backend-local equivalent is `bun run test:force-all`. Only run the full suite when the task warrants it.
- If you must mock a module, implement its **full public interface**
- Do not use `__mocks__` directories for `node_modules` mocks — they are not reliably loaded when the real module may already be cached
- **Test shared mutable state through the system under test, not through direct mutation.** The logger mock in `vitest.setup.ts` closes over shared variables; tests for stateful behaviour must interact exclusively through the API/HTTP layer
- For spy-count assertions on pi-ai calls, put them in unit tests of the transformer layer (e.g., `oauth-transformer.test.ts`) where the test owns the full call chain within a single file. Prefer asserting on observable outcomes (response values, HTTP status codes) over spy call counts for cross-file scenarios
